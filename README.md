## Motive for turning an abandoned interface to boilerplate

This project was created as an interface for a DeFi protocol, albeit met abandonment due to weak motivation of the contracting party. I could very well have started from scratch, however I want to make it a point of turning a dated project into something useful.

The purpose and scope of boilerplate will be eventually defined. It may be assumed, that being a boilerplate, it is to serve in getting a foot in the massively heavy ironwood door of building dApps which I have slightly moved after dabbling for 9 years in crypto space.

The primary motivation is to build it in top of Vue3 Composition API, and specifically avoid React, given its already prominent domination in web3 UX, which is badly hurting due to being uninviting of seasoned frontend talent, and favoring backend / systems / protocol engineers, which is precisely the ethos of React and Facebook's OSS strategy.

By that motivation, I aim to bring delightful experience to web3 frontends, and invite engineers that favor vue ecosystem.


## Planned dependencies

Boilerplate would consume planned implementations of `web3-elements`, `web3-vue` and their sub-packages for vue/nuxt integration.
